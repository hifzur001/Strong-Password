# Strong-Password
The strong password generator project is a web application that generates secure passwords for users. The application allows users to specify the length of the password and the types of characters to include, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The generated password is designed to be difficult to guess or crack, making it more secure than a weak or easily guessable password.

The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and does not require any server-side programming. The user interface includes input fields for specifying the password length and the types of characters to include, as well as a button to generate the password. The generated password is displayed in a text box on the page and can be copied to the clipboard for use in other applications.

The password generator algorithm uses a combination of random number generation and character selection to create a password that is both random and secure. The algorithm ensures that the password meets the user's specified requirements for length and character types, and does not repeat any characters or patterns that could be easily guessed or cracked.

Overall, the strong password generator project demonstrates how to create a simple but powerful tool for generating secure passwords. The project can be customized and extended to include additional features, such as password strength indicators or integration with other security tools.
